            "biography": "Neil Osborne: vocals, guitar • Dave Genn: guitar, keys  • Matt Johnson: drums • Brad Merritt: bass \n\nWith four decades of performing and recording behind them, the band has an unbelievable catalogue of hit songs. Lead by chief songwriter Neil Osborne, 54•40 have carved out a legacy of gold and platinum albums and an outstanding reputation for their live performances that carries through to this day. Forty years, twenty-five hundred performances, and twenty releases, the secret to 54•40’s longevity is their ability to redefine and reinvent themselves, taking long time 54•40 fans on a ride that is bound to pick up new fans on the way. To experience 54•40 in concert is to experience how songs have touched and continue to touch people’s lives. From people who have followed the band from their humble beginnings in East Vancouver to new young fans that have discovered the truly original band that is 54•40, a 54•40 concert is an extraordinary affair that bridges the gaps of generations through a shared love of music. \n\n“I simply can’t find the right words to describe 54•40, one of the most respected Canadian bands ever. Can one possibly gauge the accomplishments they have attained during their two-decade-long journey in one sentence? The answer in my mind is no.” - Scene Magazine\n\nIn its original trio form, 54•40 played its first gig on New Year’s Eve 1981 at the Smilin’ Buddha Cabaret in Vancouver. After recording a couple of independent releases and reconfiguring the band as a foursome, they signed with Warner Brothers in the US and released four albums. Then in 1991, 54•40 found a new home on Columbia Records at Sony Music Canada. \n\nSince then, the band has toured throughout the world, released more albums, received numerous awards and has achieved almost a dozen Top 10 hit singles. Along with their incredible songwriting ability, 54•40 expanded their horizons by opening their own studio, racking up producing and mixing credits. Neil Osborne produced Juno-nominated Jets Overhead and Winnipeg singer-songwriter Cara Luft. \n\nIn 2005, the band appropriately signed a recording agreement with True North Records, one of Canada’s longest standing independent labels. Since hooking up with True North, the band released the acclaimed “Yes To Everything” album and followed it with a live DVD titled “This Is Here This Is Now.\" The latter recorded at the magnificent Commodore Ballroom during their traditional annual October appearance at the Vancouver landmark. \n\nThroughout their journey, 54•40 remains creative and fresh, growing musically and lyrically with each project. “A band has to evolve with its audience to keep their interest,” stated Brad Merritt. “We make records based on where we’re at, at that time. So it’s kind of like a time capsule.” \n\nWhen asked about their track record, Matt Johnson once commented, “One thing we hear consistently is ‘I didn’t know you guys had so many hits,’ but we just consider ourselves songwriters. We enjoy the craft and whether we’re trying to write an eight-minute epic or just a three-minute pop song, it’s very enjoyable for us and we’re not afraid to do either.” - London Free Press\n\n “This band has showed once again that it has the songs, the talent and the personality to rise to any occasion,” said The Ottawa Citizen in a past concert review. The Calgary Herald phrased it in a different way: “Whatever the tempo, every song had a hook bound to stay imbedded in the minds of audience members, who screamed themselves hoarse.” \n\nNeil Osborne told Canadian Musician: “It’s weird every once in a while, I’ll look back and think, wow. You kind of forget where you’ve been and everything you’ve done, and how long you’ve been doing it. But then once in a while you just realize what a wealth of experience as a band together we have.” \n",

Then they pitched “Karma\" to labels to become their first release and Erick Morillo snapped it up for Subliminal.\n\nTheir first remix was of Depeche Mode’s \"Master and Servant.\" The track was supported by many of the world's top DJs. But then the incredible happened...Depeche Mode officially allowed the duo to use the original vocals from “Master and Servant”  to transform the remix into the Goom Gum track \"It's a Lot\"! \n\n“It’s a Lot” became track of the week and No. 1 on many radio shows and charts: Pete Tong, Annie Mac and MistaJam’s shows on Radio 1, Ministry Of Sound, UK Dance Chart, Cool Cute Charts, Nu Disco Beatport Chart etc.\n\nTommorowland’s  \"One World Radio\" named Goom Gum one of the 20 artists you need to listen to in the 2020!

            "biography": "The spirit of trance in the United States has long been amplified and embodied by DJ/producer Kristina Sky. From the early days of the genre, she was first integral in bringing the music’s top DJs to the West Coast masses, often for the first time, then ultimately stepping behind the booth herself in 2002. “KSky,” as she’s known to one of the most loyal and passionate fanbases in the biz, has been tapped to play all the top festivals around the world, from Armin van Buuren’s A State of Trance, sharing the stage at Coachella with Daft Punk and Madonna, multiple sets at Electric Daisy Carnival, as well as the trance-focused Dreamstate and many more top one-off events. Kristina Sky has also held many coveted residencies including America’s first weekly trance event at Arena called “Heaven,” Spundae at Circus, Insomniac Events’ “Awakening” at Exchange LA, as well as the mighty Avalon Hollywood since 2010. It was in these rooms she honed her distinct sound.\n\nKristina Sky is revered for her unique style of high energy, melodic trance combined with her signature blend of progressive house. Hailed as “One of the best progressive DJs in America,” by scene superstar John O’Callaghan, the top DJ/producers in the trance world are more than happy to sing her praises. “Kristina is living and breathing dance music,” says Dash Berlin. “Having finally met her in person on the Groove Cruise a few years ago proved to me that besides having a big heart for electronic music, she is an amazing and caring human being as well,” he says. “Kris has been there from the start, standing her ground firmly in a male-dominated industry, as where in the future she can be of great importance not only musically, but also on stage and in guiding new talent.”\n\nIn addition to her prowess on the ones-and-twos, she carefully crafts remixes and original tracks that have found their way into the hearts of both fans and fellow DJs. Her first release in 2006, “EnMass– CQ [Seek You] (Randy Boyer & Kristina Sky Remix)” debuted on Armin van Buuren’s A State of Trance imprint on his world-famous Armada label, plus received massive support from Paul van Dyk, Markus Schulz, Agnelli & Nelson, John O’Callaghan, Darude, and Sander van Doorn. The track then held the Beatport No. 1 spot for 13 consecutive weeks, followed by another 10 weeks in the Top 10. She then teamed up with Boyer again for their 2008 hit on Paul Van Dyk’s Vandit label, Kristina Sky & Randy Boyer's \"Set It Off.” Other production accomplishments include Randy Boyer & Kristina Sky ft. Cari Golden “No Limit” on Ultra Records. She’s also collaborated multiple times with Menno de Jong, such as on the Armada release “Signals.” In 2018 she was tapped to mix “Pure Trance Volume 7” which also featured a debut collaboration with Balearic king Roger Shah, “Ocean Flame”, and currently holds a spot on Solarstone’s globally respected Pure Trance roster alongside Solarstone, Factor B, Activa, Gai Barone and more, regularly playing the Pure Trance brand nights in London, Miami, Amsterdam and beyond.\n\nOne of trance’s original groundbreakers, Christopher Lawrence, has experienced many of KSky’s sets as both a fan and on the same lineups. “Kristina Sky is one of the most successful and respected DJs to rise out of the massive Los Angeles club and festival scene,” says Lawrence. “Having spent years in the trenches holding down residencies at multiple clubs and events including the world-famous Avalon in Hollywood, Kristina has earned her place in the international circuit. I have had the pleasure of playing alongside Kristina heaps of times over the years and have always been impressed with her performance and professionalism behind the decks,” he says. “Kristina Sky is a truly gifted DJ able to read a crowd and deliver exactly what the dancefloor needs.”",

            "biography": "Having an in-depth knowledge of airports might be enough to get you labelled as an international DJ these days, but describing the German-Italian Sacha Robotti, who was born and raised in Belgium, educated in the UK and Germany and now resides in the US after a significant stint in Berlin, as ‘international’ doesn’t really do him justice.\n\nExperience is arguably the sum of a person and for Sacha Robotti, his story began in classical music, playing the cello aged 7. Growing up in Brussels, he didn’t resist the lure of its thriving underground house and techno scene for long and a steady diet of electronic music provided by touring legends like Green Velvet, Jeff Mills, Dave Clarke and Dave Clarke helped sow the seeds for the Slothacid empire he’s now building in 2020.\n\nSacha’s professional music career began in Berlin around 2005 where his time as one half of Robosonic helped build his profile as a respected producer, DJ and label owner. However, it was in 2010 when the solo sounds of Sacha Robotti really started to take shape with his debut track “Tingly Trumpets”. Fast forward a full decade and Sacha Robotti is now something of a household name in certain dance music circles - if not by name directly, then almost certainly known for the Sloth motif which has come to represent his Slothacid brand across merch, sell-out tours and most recently as an independent record label and platform by which Sacha supports up-and-coming talent.\n\nBut we’re getting ahead of ourselves because ten years is a long time and you’re probably wondering what happened during that period, right? Well, to cut a long story short - it included releases on Klasse, FOOD, Snatch!, Octopus Recordings, Sweat It Out, Desert Hearts, a Beatport #1 on Suara, and of course Dirtybird where he has become a longstanding member of the family with multiple EPs, collabs and a VIP joint with Claude Vonstroke himself. This ten-year journey saw Sacha’s sound evolve for sure, but the fusion of techno, house and booty-shaking basslines has remained consistent throughout and explains why Sacha counts the likes of Seth Troxler, Dubfire, Chris Lake, Ellen Allien & Nicole Moudaber as supporters of his music - an output that has put him on prestigious lineups at events like CRSSD Festival, Electric Forest, EDC, Nocturnal Wonderland and many more.\n\nWith the timeline almost complete, let’s slow things down to take a closer look at 2019 - the year that marked a change in pace for the Slothacid brand and perhaps the year that cemented the direction Sacha’s career will take over the next decade. Summer 2019 saw Sacha Robotti launch the Slothacid record label - a launch which was supported by Billboard, no less, as well as a largely sold-out 30-date open-to-close concept tour of North America and Canada. It was a statement of intent for Robotti, and one which has since seen him expand the vision of Slothacid as a platform for not only his own productions, but also as a way to support the talent around him with two releases per month and an eclectic sound that takes in club culture, acid, techno, electro and everything in-between. \n\nAs 2020 draws to a close, Slothacid has laid solid foundations with boundary and genre pushing releases, including a collaborative EP by the entire Saunderson family - brothers Dantiez and Damarii, along with their parents Ann and Kevin - Detroit’s very own techno royalty whose ‘Signature Move’ package caught the attention of Billboard, Forbes, BBC Radio 1 and more. For Sacha, it iss collab with techno mainstay, SIAN on his Octopus label and promises of joints with Kevin Knapp, Mikey Lion, Dantiez Saunderson and more that sets things up perfectly for 2021 and ensures 2020 is remembered as a career-defining step rather than a socially distanced memory for this particular Sloth.\n",

            "biography": "When they first appeared in the early 2000s, Ladytron combined the fundamentals of classic synth pop -- crystalline melodies enveloped in icy textures and rippling arpeggios -- with touches of indie pop, shoegaze, disco, and industrial music, and conjured distinctly different moods on each album, spanning the hook-laden simplicity of 2001's 604 to the darker feel of 2005's landmark Witching Hour to 2011's meditative Gravity the Seducer. They bridged the gap between synth pop's original '80s heyday and its renaissance in the 2010s. Following their critically acclaimed debut 604, their Los Angeles recorded follow up, Light & Magic, a darker, more streamlined set of songs including the single Seventeen was released in 2002.  It reached number seven on Billboard's Top Dance/Electronic Albums chart.\n\nTheir third album Witching Hour released in 2005,  was another critical success, led by single Destroy Everything You Touch”  2008's Velocifero recorded in Paris reached number three on Billboard's Top Dance/Electronic Albums chart, and marked the band's debut on Billboard's 200 Albums chart. Ladytron performed at the invitation of Brian Eno at the Sydney Opera House in 2009. They produced and co-wrote two songs that appeared on Bionic, the 2010 album by  Christina Aguilera. Following a hiatus after 2011’s Gravity the Seducer, in 2016 they began work on their eponymous sixth album; which reached number ten on Billboard's Independent Albums Chart.",
